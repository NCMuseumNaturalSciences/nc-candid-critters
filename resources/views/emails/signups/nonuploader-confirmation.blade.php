<p><strong>Dear prospective Candid Critters Participant:</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for registering for NC Candid Critters! We are excited about your interest in this important project, and weâ€™re glad to have you as part of our team. With the help of volunteers like you, we are advancing understanding of wildlife and improving management and conservation efforts across our state.</p>

<p>Before you can set your camera, we ask you to take a short online training course so you will be setting wildlife cameras using the study's mandatory protocol. You will be assigned to the online training course within 2-3 days. <strong><u>When training has been assigned, you will receive an email from "course_assignements@myicourse.com", which may get routed to your Spam folder. Thus, please make sure to check your spam folder over the next few days in order to access the training course. Please use your email address and the password "emammal" to log in once you have received this email. Once you have completed the training course, you will receive a confirmation email from us informing you of the next steps in the process.</u></strong></p>

<p>Once again, thank you for signing up for the NC Candid Critters Project. We look forward to working with you, and can't wait to see the wildlife photos from your camera deployments!</p>

<p>Happy Camera Trapping!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
    The Candid Critters Team<br>
