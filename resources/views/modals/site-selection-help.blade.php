                <p>Welcome to the Site Selection Map! This is where you can choose a pre-selected site to set up a camera trap for NC Candid Critters on state or federal public lands. Click on the purple dots on the map to view the information associated with each site.</p>
                <p><strong><u>WHEN YOU SELECT A SITE</u></strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Copy down the <strong>site name, coordinates, and any notes</strong> from the site manager</li>
                    <li>Enter the requested information and click “reserve site”</li>
                    <li><strong><em><u>Make sure that you contact the site manager ahead of time if this was stated in the notes from the site manager!</u></em></strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Use the buttons in the top right hand corner of this screen to help you navigate the map.</p>
                <p>To find the closest site to your address:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter your address in the search box at the top left corner of the map. Once you enter an address, the map will automatically pan to the selected address (displayed as a green map maker).</li>
                    <li>Click the 'Find Nearest' button located above the top right corner of the map (next to reset).</li>
                    <li>The nearest pre-selected site should be displayed as a blue dot in the middle of the map.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you would like driving directions to the closest address to the selected site, click the 'Get Route' button located next to the ‘Find Nearest’ button at the top right corner of the map. The route should appear as a red line on the map and a window containing the driving directions should then appear in the lower right corner of the map.</p>
