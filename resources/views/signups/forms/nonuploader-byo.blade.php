    <p><span class="text-important">PLEASE NOTE:</span> In agreement for providing you with a state-of-the-art camera trap to explore the secret lives of mammals, we must be able to obtain the data you collect. The data collected from this survey will be stored within the Smithsonian Institution to be used by present and future scientists; therefore, it is important that we collect data from all participants.</p>
    <p>We must somehow receive pictures from participants so they can be added to our database. There are three options for doing so, which you will be able to choose from later in this form. They are to upload the pictures using our specially developed software, share the pictures with us digitally using Google Drive or Dropbox, or mail us SD cards using US Mail. We will provide you with extra cards you choose this last option.</p>
