<h3>Photography Waiver</h3>
<fieldset>
    <p>Photographs are being taken as part of the NC Candid Critters project (the “Project”) in which camera trap photographs will be used for data analysis, publication, and potentially as part of public exhibits. Although the main goal is to photograph wildlife, capturing some pictures of humans are inevitable.</p>

<h3>Participation Waiver</h3>
<fieldset>
    <p>When placing and retrieving the camera, I am responsible to take due care and diligence that would be expected for any backwoods hike. I will use my best judgment in approaching the suggested deployment location and redeploy at an alternative site if judged unsafe. I expressly release theProject and its supporting agencies from and against any and all claims which I may have for injuries arising from the deployment of the cameras. <span class="text-danger text-required">*</span></p>
