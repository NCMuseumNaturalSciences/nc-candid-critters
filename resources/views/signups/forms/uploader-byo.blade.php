    <p><span class="text-important">PLEASE NOTE:</span> In agreement for providing you with a state-of-the-art camera trap to explore the secret lives of mammals, we must be able to obtain the data you collect. The data collected from this survey will be stored within the Smithsonian Institution to be used by present and future scientists; therefore, it is important that we collect data from all participants.</p>
    <p>If you would like to participate in this project, please be aware that in addition to setting the camera, you will need to commit approximately 1 hour of your time to:<br>
        1.	Identify animals that your camera captures<br>
        2.	Upload all of your images to the Smithsonian - PLEASE DO NOT DELETE ANY PHOTOS, blank or "boring" photos are still good photos!<br>
        The necessary software and a tutorial will be provided to you.</p>
